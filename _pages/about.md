**Research:** The goal of my work is to develop tools that allow space mission designers working in multibody dynamics to design feasible intial trajecotries in real time. Right now, I am focused on using generative neural networks, specifically diffusion models, to hot-start traditional trajectory optimization tools. My research advisor is [Dr. Dan Erwin](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Erwin/Daniel), and our reaserch is graciously funded through a fellowship from [Advanced Space LLC](https://advancedspace.com/). I also currently work part-time as an Assocuiate Astrodynamics and Machine Learning Engineer at Advanced Space. 

**Previously** I recived my joint B.S. and M.S. in Astronautical Engineering from [USC Viterbi](https://astronautics.usc.edu/) in 2021. My previous research at the USC [Space Engineering Research Center](https://www.isi.edu/centers-serc/) focused on applying genetic algorithms for safe spacecraft swarm operations. Our patent can be found [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=7S8svBwAAAAJ&citation_for_view=7S8svBwAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C). My past internships were as a Space Systems Engineering intern at [Northrop Grumman](https://www.northropgrumman.com/), and as a Technology Scout and Analyst at the [Starbusrt Aerosapce Accelerator](https://starburst.aero/)
