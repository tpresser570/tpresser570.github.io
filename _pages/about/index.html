Right now, I am focused on using generative neural networks, specifically diffusion models, to hot-start traditional trajectory optimization tools. My research advisor is <a href="https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Erwin/Daniel" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dr. Dan Erwin</a>, and our reaserch is graciously funded through a fellowship from <a href="https://advancedspace.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Advanced Space LLC</a>. I also currently work part-time as an Assocuiate Astrodynamics and Machine Learning Engineer at Advanced Space.</p> <p><strong>Previously</strong> I recived my joint B.S. and M.S. in Astronautical Engineering from <a href="https://astronautics.usc.edu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">USC Viterbi</a> in 2021. My previous research at the USC <a href="https://www.isi.edu/centers-serc/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Space Engineering Research Center</a> focused on applying genetic algorithms for safe spacecraft swarm operations.
